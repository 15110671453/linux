config IMX_WEIM
	bool "Freescale EIM DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Driver for i.MX WEIM controller.
	  The WEIM(Wireless External Interface Module) works like a bus.
	  You can attach many different devices on it, such as NOR, onenand.

config MVEBU_MBUS
	bool
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	help
	  Driver needed for the MBus configuration on Marvell EBU SoCs
	  (Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x, MV78XX0 and Armada 370/XP).

config OMAP_OCP2SCP
	tristate "OMAP OCP2SCP DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Driver to enable ocp2scp module which transforms ocp interface
	  protocol to scp protocol. In OMAP4, USB PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP and in OMAP5, both USB PHY and SATA PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP.

config OMAP_INTERCONNECT
	tristate "OMAP INTERCONNECT DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS

	help
	  Driver to enable OMAP interconnect error handling driver.

config ARM_CCI
	bool "ARM CCI driver support"
	depends on ARM
	help
	  Driver supporting the CCI cache coherent interconnect for ARM
	  platforms.

config ARM_SYSTEM_PROFILER
	tristate "ARM System Profiler support"
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on OF && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Some ARM-based platforms contain a System Profiler component that can
	  provide profiling data about bus, interconnect and memory traffic
	  flowing through the system.  This can be useful for system tuning and
	  identifying performance bottlenecks.

	  Say Y or M here to provide support for obtaining profiling
	  information using the System Profiler.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Note: For this to be anything more than a toy, you should also enable
	  ftrace (try ENABLE_DEFAULT_TRACERS).  This enables reporting of each
	  data capture via trace events.  Without this, you can still capture
	  data manually, but you will need to poll from userspace: reliability
	  and precision will suffer and overheads will be very high.
